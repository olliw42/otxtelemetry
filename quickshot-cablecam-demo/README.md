OlliW Telemetry Widget Script for OpenTx with MAVlink
===========

This is a demo of a very simple drone quickshot: cable cam.

It was tested and used with OlliW's OpenTx MAVLink v04rc01, which is based on OpenTx 2.3.5. 

OpenTx and wherewith the project has migrated to be based on OpenTx 2.3.7. This script here was adapted to the required changes, but was not explicitely tested for this updated firmware. It should run fine, but as said, was not explicit tested.
